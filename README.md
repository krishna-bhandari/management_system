this is a basic system for managing a shop(in this case a computer repairing center).Due to work overload it is difficult to manage the records of the devices came for repair.
So to manage that I tried to make a system that will be able to keep the records ,update and delete the records.Along with this I want to add some more features like managing the
users creating a detail of work done by individual staff and so on.

So if are intrested in this project then I will be very thankfull by getting your contribution and please make it much more better (although its not so much good now :) ).
